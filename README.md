# Marvel Characters

This project is an app that is connected to an external APIs and showing the result from it, which is marvel characters. 
It is developed for Appspace assignment, using React js with styled-components; for generating a hash for API route md5 from crypto-js library is used; for API calls
 - axios; the rest of the components are developed from scratch and in some cases icons from react-icons library are used.
 
 The app itself is single-page represented in two screens:
  Listing, which is the main and only component passed to the App.js where you can find all the functionality related to API calls, filtering data, 
  displaying it and much more;
  Detail, the hidden card that shows detailed information of the selected element when active;
 
Apart from these two main components the app also contains searchbar, using which you can navigate through the page, card component that serves for displaying 
data to the user in Listing and a Modal that pops up a second after the page is loaded.
The app is fully responsive and optimized for all devices with special features available for some of them (ex. detailed card component displaying close icon 
if the owner has a Touch Screen Device and displaying nothing otherwise)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
